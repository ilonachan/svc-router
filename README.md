# svc-router

A UDP router for the **Simple Voice Chat** mod that pairs with [mc-router](https://github.com/itzg/mc-router) to direct audio traffic to the correct backend server.

## Overview

[mc-router](https://github.com/itzg/mc-router) is a lightweight connection multiplexer that routes TCP traffic based on the server address (hostname) in the initial Minecraft handshake. This allows hosting multiple servers on a single public IP.

**svc-router** works alongside [mc-router](https://github.com/itzg/mc-router) to handle the UDP traffic required by the Simple Voice Chat mod. It listens for connection webhooks to dynamically map a player's UDP voice packets to the correct backend server, ensuring voice chat works transparently across your backend.

## Architecture

1. **TCP Handshake:** Player connects to [mc-router](https://github.com/itzg/mc-router).
2. **Webhook Trigger:** [mc-router](https://github.com/itzg/mc-router) sends a POST webhook to `svc-router` containing the player's UUID and the target backend address.
3. **Route Creation:** `svc-router` creates an internal mapping: `UUID -> Backend UDP IP`.
4. **UDP Voice Stream:** The player's voice client sends UDP packets to `svc-router`. The router inspects the packet header for the UUID and forwards it to the mapped backend.

## Configuration

### 1. Configure mc-router
You must configure [mc-router](https://github.com/itzg/mc-router) to broadcast connection events to this application.

Add the `-webhook-url` flag to your startup command, pointing to the HTTP address of `svc-router`:

```bash
# Example: svc-router running on the same host, port 80
./mc-router -webhook-url "http://localhost:8080/event" ...
```

### 2. Running svc-router
**Default Ports:**
* **UDP Listening:** `0.0.0.0:24454` (Simple Voice Chat Traffic)
* **HTTP Listening:** `0.0.0.0:8080` (Webhooks)

**Run via Docker (Example):**
```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 24454:24454/udp \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  --name svc-router \
  jschuler99/svc-router:latest
```
